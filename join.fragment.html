		<div class="header"><h3>Why join?</h3></div>
		<div class="12u">
			<p>By joining the CRC, you are standing behind our demands to honor our rights as graduate students and improve our compensation as employees of CU. <b>By becoming a member, you give us all a louder voice.</b> As of August 2018, the membership form also collects "consent for representation" that gives our grassroots organization union more legal clout in advocating on behalf of our members. Although we resolve to continue fighting for everybody, our organization is entirely run by members and your membership gives you full voting rights.
		</div>

		<div class="header"><h3>How will my dues be used?</h3></div>
		<div class="12u">
			<p>Dues are necessary to help us have a more united voice. Dues cover the costs of organizing: trainings, printing flyers, hiring professional assistants, buying visuals for demonstrations, and filing fees for paperwork required by law to operate a charitable organization. We are incorporated and registered in Colorado to operate as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, and officers are statutorily prohibited from benefiting from proceeds &mdash; all money we collect goes to organizing and operating expenses. With careful planning and identifying donors for certain costs, we have been able to keep the cost of membership very low: <b>dues are $15 per semester</b>, and we recommend paying a whole year upfront.</p>
			<p>In 2017-2018, our first year of operation as an official dues-paying organization, our largest expenses expressed as percentages of total revenue were: sending three of our core organizers to the <a href="http://thecgeu.org/">CGEU</a> annual meeting in New York City for international collaboration and training (27%); printing flyers, posters, and informational pamphlets (23%); food and supplies for large meetings and collective direct actions (8%); advertising such as stickers intended to spread the word of our existence (6%); hired professional assistance (5%). Dues provided 83% of our income with small private donations accounting for the rest.</p>

		<div class="12u">
			<p>There are two ways to join: in person or online.</p>
			<p><b>To join online, <a href="https://membership.bouldercrc.org/">click here</a>.</b></p>
			<p><b>To join in person</b>, contact <a href="mailto:membership@bouldercrc.org">membership@bouldercrc.org</a> to arrange for an organizer to meet you. Dues in person are payable by check written to Boulder CRC, by cash, or by Venmo with the handle @BoulderCRC.</p>
			<p>We recommend paying dues for the full year so that we can spend more time on our activism instead of repeatedly trying to renew membership for the same people. (But don't be a stranger!)</p>
			<p>Please note: although we operate as a nonprofit organization and have filed an intent to operate as a 501(c)(4) with the IRS, <b>contributions are not tax-deductible</b> at this time because we have opted for the freedom to spend a substantial amount of proceeds toward political lobbying.</p>
