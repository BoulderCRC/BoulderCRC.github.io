		<header>Why join?</header>
		<p>By joining the CRC, you are standing behind our demands to honor our rights and improve our compensation as employees of CU. By becoming a member, you <b>give us all a louder voice</b>. Although we resolve to continue fighting for everybody, <b>our organization is run by the votes of members</b>.

		<header>How will my dues be used?</header>
		<p>Dues are necessary to help us have a more united voice, by covering the cost of printing flyers, running a website, buying visuals for demonstrations (such as the ribbons we got for the Regent meeting last year), and filing fees for paperwork required by law to operate a charitable organization. We are incorporated and registered in Colorado to operate as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, and officers are statutorily prohibited from benefiting from proceeds &mdash; all money we collect goes to organizing and operating expenses. With careful planning and identifying donors for certain costs, we have been able to budget an active first year as an official organization with minimal impact to our underfunded wallets:<b>dues are $10 per semester</b>, and we recommend paying a whole year upfront. Please note that although we operate as a nonprofit organization and have filed an intent to operate as a 501(c)(4) with the IRS, contributions are not tax-deductible at this time because we have opted for the freedom to spend a substantial amount of proceeds toward political lobbying.</p>
