						<h3>Equitable pay</h3>
					</header>

	                <p>CU-Boulder pays its graduate employees approximately 58% of regional self-sufficiency wage,
			after required fees and supplies.</p>

	                <p>We demand a self-sufficient wage and accurate regional cost of living adjustment.</p>

						<h3>Full waiver</h3>
					</header>

					<p>CU-Boulder's graduate employees often receive less than full funding, even while
					performing work comparable to their fully-funded peers.</p>

					<p>We demand full tuition and fees remission for all graduate employees.</p>

						<h3>Transparency &amp; inclusion</h3>
					</header>
	                <p>CU Boulder delayed and censored the Graduate Student Social Climate Survey,
	                obstructing efforts to better include underrepresented populations.</p>

	                <p>We demand transparency about all findings of how our campus can improve.</p>
