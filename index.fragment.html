                            <p style="text-align:center;">Graduate employees (such as TAs, RAs, and GPTIs) perform a great portion of academic labor that is
                            fundamental to CU-Boulder's statutory mission to be a world-class research and education university.</p>
                            <p style="text-align:center;">Despite our labor, we face many struggles as university employees,
                            ranging from insufficient wages to hostile social environments at work.</p>
                            <p style="text-align:center;">We envision and actively pursue a fair, inclusive, and democratic campus for all.</p>
