				<p>We are CU's independent labor union for graduate employees. We have been described as <strong>"the most impressive effort" in decades to organize CU's graduate workers</strong> in this <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_32440565/cu-boulder-grad-student-workers-push-union-comes">front page story</a> in the Daily Camera and Denver Post. We are a rank-and-file union run entirely by volunteer graduate workers and direct democracy of our members.</p>
				<p>Graduate employees (such as TAs, RAs, and GPTIs) perform a great portion of academic labor that is
				fundamental to CU-Boulder's statutory mission to be a world-class research and education university.</p>
				<p>Despite our labor, we face many struggles as university employees,
				ranging from insufficient wages to hostile social environments at work.</p>
				<p>We envision and actively pursue a fair, inclusive, and democratic campus for all.</p>
