				<p>We are CU's independent labor union for graduate employees. We have been described as <strong>"the most impressive effort" in decades to organize CU's graduate workers</strong> in this <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_32440565/cu-boulder-grad-student-workers-push-union-comes">front page story</a> in the Daily Camera and Denver Post. We are a rank-and-file union run entirely by volunteer graduate workers and direct democracy of our members.</p>
				<p>Graduate employees (such as TAs, RAs, and GPTIs) perform a great portion of academic labor that is
				fundamental to CU-Boulder's statutory mission to be a world-class research and education university.</p>
				<p>Despite our labor, we face many struggles as university employees,
				ranging from insufficient wages to hostile social environments at work.</p>
				<p>We envision and actively pursue a fair, inclusive, and democratic campus for all.</p>

						<h3>Equitable pay</h3>

	                <p>CU-Boulder pays its graduate employees approximately 58% of regional self-sufficiency wage,
			after required fees and supplies.</p>

	                <p>We demand a self-sufficient wage and accurate regional cost of living adjustment.</p>

						<h3>Full waiver</h3>

					<p>CU-Boulder's graduate employees often receive less than full funding, even while
					performing work comparable to their fully-funded peers.</p>

					<p>We demand full tuition and fees remission for all graduate employees.</p>

						<h3>Transparency &amp; inclusion</h3>

	                <p>CU Boulder delayed and censored the Graduate Student Social Climate Survey,

	    <div class="11u 12u(narrow)">
	        <ul class="text">
			<li>Sparked a vigorous campaign to waive student fees for graduate employees and organized a mass walkout around the issue (coverage including this <a href="https://www.apnews.com/cfb3938ce7154c71bdea13077744246d">front page story</a>, the <a href="https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2019/02/08/guest-post-its-time-to-end-university-of-colorados-onerous-student-fees/">Colorado Independent</a>, Colorado Public Radio, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/graduate-students-mounting-degrees-of-protest-over-hidden-fees/2019/08/02/a7f19f3c-b3c8-11e9-8949-5f36ff92706e_story.html">Washington Post</a>)</li>
	            <li>Secured a 19.8% raise for TAs since the CRC started in 2016 (<a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_30024771/cu-boulder-graduate-students-demand-higher-wages-offset">front page story</a>)</li>
		    <li>Won transparency on the 2014 Graduate Student Social Climate survey (<a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_31388894/new-data-shows-cu-boulder-lgbtq-grad-students">front page story</a>), holding admin accountable for unreasonable delay and dishonesty around it</li>
		    <li>Helped our members win thousands of dollars of overdue wages, in consultation with an employment lawyer, and developed <a href="/wagetheft">a web app</a> to streamline the process of initiating the legal process to recover stolen wages at CU</li>
		    <li>Researched how our benefits compare to other universities, found that we're the only Pac-12 university that fails to provide any paid parental leave (<a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_31989719/cu-boulder-grad-students-advocate-paid-parental-leave">front page story</a>)</li>
		    <li>Earned <a href="/docs/BFA-SSS-resolution.pdf">unanimous support from the Boulder Faculty Assembly faculty support (pdf document)</a> that calls for "even more decisive, aggressive, and rapid action" to meet the <a href="/manual/living">local living wage standard</a></li>

	            <li>Met with Dean Schmiesing, Provost Moore, and Chief Financial Officer Fox to communicate the gravity of our issues</li>
		    <li>Initiated communication with, and won support from, numerous state legislators, public officials, and labor leaders</li>
		    <li>Incorporated and registered as a non-profit organization to help secure a strong and independent union with <strong>legal standing to sign and enforce a legally-binding collective bargaining agreement to protect our wins</strong></li>
