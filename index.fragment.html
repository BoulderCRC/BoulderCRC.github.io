		    <p style="text-align:center;">Graduate employees (such as TAs, RAs, and GPTIs) perform a great portion of academic labor that is
		    fundamental to CU-Boulder's statutory mission to be a world-class research and education university.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:center;">Despite our labor, we face many struggles as university employees,
		    ranging from insufficient wages to hostile social environments at work.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:center;">We envision and actively pursue a fair, inclusive, and democratic campus for all.</p>

						<h3>Equitable pay</h3>
					</header>

	                <p>CU-Boulder pays its graduate employees approximately 65% of regional self-sufficiency wage,
	                less than any other PAC-12 institution.</p>

	                <p>We demand a self-sufficient wage and accurate regional cost of living adjustment.</p>

						<h3>Full tuition waiver</h3>
					</header>
	                <p>CU-Boulder's graduate employees often receive less than full funding, even while
	                performing work comparable to their fully-funded peers.</p>

	                <p>We demand full tuition remission for all graduate employees.</p>

						<h3>Transparency &amp; inclusion</h3>

	                <p>CU Boulder delayed and censored the Graduate Student Social Climate Survey,
