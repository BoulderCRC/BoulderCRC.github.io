            <section>
                <p>My name is Maggie Jacoby and I am a graduate student in the architectural engineering department working as a research assistant. I am in my thirties and I have always hoped to have kids of my own. I want to tell you why that’s a challenge at CU.</p>

                <p>My education started traditionally with a bachelor's in math from UC Davis. I spent nearly 10 years working towards a career before deciding to take the financial hit and go back to school to earn a graduate degree in architectural engineering at CU. While I knew the program was what I wanted to do, the fact that I would be 33 years old when I got my masters gave me pause: I was, and still am, in a relationship with the person I plan to spend my life with (who is also a graduate student worker), and I had hoped to be starting a family by that time. I began the program anyway, figuring I would deal with those decisions down the line.</p>

                <p>During my first year I was offered the opportunity to work on a prestigious research project as a PhD student. This was a chance to work on something that excites me, and it put me in a position to attain my career goals. On the other hand it delays my entry to another job where I can expect paid parental leave, unlike my current job at CU. Again I struggled for a long time with the choice. I didn’t want to forgo a PhD or my dream career, just because I wanted to have a family in the future. At the same time it felt dangerous to embark on this path, knowing I could be giving up the chance to start a family at all.</p>

                <p>This shouldn’t have to be a choice, between a family or an academic career. But my job at CU provides not even one week of paid parental leave. This communicates to me a culture that values what I can do for the university but does not value who I am.</p>
