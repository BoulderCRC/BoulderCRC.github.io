					The biggest expense for graduate employees is housing. If you’re struggling to pay rent or find affordable housing, you are not alone. It’s no secret that living in Boulder and the surrounding areas is expensive. In 2015, Boulder was ranked the 3<sup>rd</sup> most expensive college town by Realtor.com <sup>1</sup>. While Relator’s claim is based on sale price of homes, renting an apartment or a room in the Boulder area is also incredibly difficult on a graduate employee budget.

					The data below show that even without additional mandatory expenses such as utilities, food, transportation, and course materials, the highest paid graduate employees are still spending substantially more on rent than the frequently bank-recommended 30%. The CU Money Sense <sup>2</sup> website recommends the 50/30/20 rule, where necessary expenses should not exceed 50% of your income, personal expenses should not exceed 30%, and 20% of your income should go towards savings. These “budget smart” recommendations, however, are unfeasible for graduate employees, many of whom are already paying more than the 50% of their salary solely on rent, before adding other necessary expenses.

					In fact, it’s getting worse. Rental price trends indicate that the gap between graduate employee income and housing costs has grown substantially in the past 5 years, and shows no sign of slowing down. The Colorado Constitution prohibits rent control laws. Such laws prohibit landlords from increasing the rent as much as they want each time a lease ends. As can be seen in the chart below, the percent increase in rent year to year is often MUCH greater than the stipend increase graduate employees receive.

					As can be seen, in the past 5 years (AY 2011-2012 to AY 2016-2017) the average monthly rent of a 2 bedroom-1 bathroom unit has gone up by 44%. Comparatively, graduate employee pay increases have only gone up 21% since 2011. As such, living in the Boulder area has become increasingly difficult for graduate employees.  While rent prices continue to rise in the Boulder area, graduate employee stipends have not kept pace.

					When voicing concerns about skyrocketing rental costs, a common refrain graduate employees hear is “Don’t live in Boulder”. This response fails to recognize two fundamental realities; (1) rental prices are on the rise throughout the Denver Metro area, and (2) relocating outside of Boulder adds additional expenses and travel time to and from campus. Living outside of Boulder also adds the stress of being further removed from the health services provided at Wardenburg health center, among other inconveniences. For graduate employees without cars, options for housing outside of Boulder are additionally limited to places with bus-line access. The table below shows exactly how expensive housing is in the Denver Metro area:

					As this table shows, there are very few areas where the CU Boulder recommended 50/30/20 rule would apply, even at a 50% appointment, and even fewer areas where the 30% rule would work. Graduate employees at lower appointments are at an even greater disadvantage when searching for housing.

		        <p>
					In the current rental market, it is uncommon that a graduate employee can afford to rent an apartment alone. This situation forces graduate employees to seek out shared living arrangements or roommates. In order to offset high housing costs, many graduate employees choose to share their home with three or more roommates. This arrangement is typically illegal, as the City of Boulder zoning bans more than three unrelated people from sharing the majority of homes.
				</p>

                <!--
				<p>
					If you find yourself under scrutiny for roommates who do not match the city’s regressive definition of a family, be advised that the usual guidelines apply for dealing with law enforcement. You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to speak with a lawyer, and you have the right to deny access to your home unless law enforcement has obtained a warrant. Sometimes people choose to give theirPerhaps the most effective, but possibly illegal, way to deal with an inspection is to give your home a makeover; make it look as if three people live there. Stack mattresses on top of one another until there areyou have three beds; even a guest bed can be considered evidence. Put away all but three toothbrushes. Cover names on the chore board or internal mail distribution system. Et cetera.
