			<h2>Issues We Know Happen</h2>
      <h3>You Are Not Alone</h3>
		</header>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="12u">
		        <p class="justify">
              Compensation is a major concern for graduate employees at CU Boulder, but it’s far from the only issue we face.  In addition to financial stressors, navigating the politics and power structures built into a research institution as a graduate employee can be simultaneously comical, bewildering, and maddening. And the social climate situation is grave.  Graduates, as both employees and students, are particularly vulnerable to retribution for trying to address these issues and our advocacy groups have been blocked from gaining access to data that may help us address our issues.
		        </p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="">
			<h2>The 2014 Social Climate Survey</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="12u">
		    <p>
          In 2014, CU Boulder issued a “social climate” survey, to which 1,603 grad students responded<sup>1</sup>. This was a big survey that touched on many topics. One of its stated goals was to identify the extent of discrimination and harassment on campus, in particular for grad students. <strong>CU administration has still only released extremely limited data from this survey.</strong>  It is only after pressure from CRC and UGGS that university has committed to release partial information from the 2014 Graduate Student Climate Survey<sup>2</sup>. We are still awaiting the release of more detailed data obtained from the survey.
				</p>
        <p>
          Based on the questions that appear in the survey, and what little that has been released, it seems clear that administration is hiding results that could look unbecoming of the university. But failing to release these important data about what issues the campus faces precludes us in the rank-and-file from a data-driven approach to making our campus better. This is why one of CRC’s primary demands is for the administration to release the survey results. Many of the problems have been identified, but the administration is hiding them. When the issues are out in the open, it will be much easier to start addressing them.
        </p>
			</div>

		<div class="">
			<h2>The Issues</h2>
      <h3>Appointments</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="12u">
		    <p>
          Many graduate employees get their primary funding through university appointments: teaching assistant (TA), research assistant (RA), or graduate part-time instructor (GPTI). However,  the allocation of appointments within departments often lack transparency. While there are university-wide criteria for what type of work goes with what type of appointment, the process varies across departments and seems to lack consistency.  Graduate employees are sometimes misclassified, e.g. paid as a TA while performing the work of a GPTI. Campus policy states that graduate employees cannot be classified below Student Assistant VI, but some university employers may still try to do this<sup>3</sup>.
				</p>
        <p>
          An additional concern is that many departments do not provide employees with 50% appointments. Graduate employees may have to scrape together multiple teaching and grading positions to add up to something close to even a 30% appointment. Some appointments are as low as 15%. Tuition remission is scaled to appointment percentage.  Employees with appointments at below 25% do not get full tuition waivers, yet still need to be enrolled in 5 credits to be considered full time students (see table below)<sup>4</sup>.  Even those with 25% appointments often have to pay tuition because courses are mostly 3 credits each, making it necessary in practice to take 6 credits to meet the minimum enrollment requirement.
        </p>

          <figcaption>NOTE: Appointment percentages that fall between listed percentiles will always carry the tuition credit associated with the lower number. For example, a 38% appointment would carry a tuition credit of 7 credit hours.</figcaption>
        </figure>
				<p>
          In many cases graduate employees work substantially more than what their appointment level would indicate. While graduate employees can keep track of hours worked, many do not feel comfortable speaking out if they are working more than their stipend covers. In one case, a graduate student was given an extra 6% to develop an entirely new class. The hours spent on this far exceeded a 6% pay increase. This is one example of misclassification of hours worked and of graduate employee exploitation.
				</p>
			</div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Admission Letter v. Offer Letter</h3>
		</div>

    <div class="row">
			<div class="12u">
		    <p>
          When you were admitted, you may have received a wonderful offer for a 4-year stipend. Know that your <strong>admission letter</strong> is NOT LEGALLY BINDING. If a department faces a funding crunch, there is nothing to prevent it from refusing support to its graduate employees. The lack of a  “just cause” provision in our hiring agreements means we are employees “at will” whose contracts can be terminated at any time, for  any reason.
				</p>
        <p>
          At the start of each semester, graduate employees sign an <strong>offer letter</strong>, in which they are also considered an employee “at will”, meaning appointments can be shifted or terminated. The university and your department can change your position, payment, and appointment percentage each semester. These changes have adversely affected many graduates who sign year-long leases and in January suddenly find they cannot afford their home or need to find an additional job to make ends meet.
        </p>
			</div>
		</div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Rights to Your Work: Intellection Property and Authorship</h3>
		</div>

    <div class="row">
			<div class="12u">
		    <p>
          While CU is full of big-hearted, intellectually honest faculty there are also faculty members who have climbed the ladder by taking advantage of collaborators and their graduate students. In general, there are unclear intellectual property rights for graduate student ideas. Faculty may “borrow” your ideas and run with them, and the degree of offense can range from the innocent assumption by your advisor that a suggestion that you made in lab meeting was an idea of their own, all the way to (a true story) finding out from a journal once you have submitted your article for publication that a nearly identical paper is already in review at said journal and is authored by your advisor.
				</p>
        <p>
          Graduate students receive little to no training on what degree of work warrants authorship, and this threshold often varies drastically across research groups. This uncertainty can leave graduate students vulnerable to making strong contributions without appropriate credit. Discussions about authorship early in your involvement in a project can mitigate miscommunications later down the line.
        </p>
			</div>
		</div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Relationship with Advisor</h3>
		</div>

    <div class="row">
			<div class="12u">
		    <p>
          Advisors are meant to be mentors who support graduate interests and career pursuits, yet this is not always the case. Advisors may push their graduate students to contribute to their own research agenda, forcing students in a direction that does not match their professional goals.  Advisors may do this by threatening graduate employment, ability to graduate, or ability to continue on as their advisee. These examples constitute harassment and are NOT acceptable.  Beyond fulfilling the duties that justify employment at the university (TA, RA, etc.), the work that you do as a graduate student should absolutely align with your own interests, aspirations, and professional development!
				</p>
        <p>
          Addressing these conflicts can be difficult because of the inherent power dynamics built into the research system. After all, your advisor may have played a large role in getting you admitted into the program, provided you with opportunities that you wouldn’t otherwise have had in the past, and will ultimately be writing your letter of recommendation.
        </p>
			</div>
		</div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Harassment</h3>
		</div>

    <div class="row">
			<div class="12u">
		    <p>
          Across campus, graduate employees witness and/or are victims of harassment including bullying, intimidation, and violent treatment that can lead to abandoning grad school or worse.  The climate survey, results show that 1 in 10 graduate students have faced some kind of harassment during their time at CU, and that this has disproportionately impacted women.  The internal culture within departments can also enable harassment; in 2014, the Philosophy department was implicated in a sexual harassment scandal that highlighted years of inappropriate conduct by department faculty. While aware of these issues, that the department failed to adequately responded to them<sup>5</sup>.  Because of the strong power imbalances at work for many graduate employees, bringing issues of harassment to the attention of your department can be difficult.  While there is an official university channels to report harassment<sup>6</sup>, graduate employees do not have any outside means to help us with these grievances.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Diversity</h3>
		</div>

    <div class="row">
			<div class="12u">
		    <p>
          You may have noticed that the campus lacks socioeconomic and ethnic diversity. Boulder is 88% white<sup>7</sup> and has a high median household income of $69,407<sup>8</sup>.  The campus population is not much better with only 17% of graduate students from minority groups <sup>9</sup>.
				</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../images/manual/facultyrace.png" alt="Graph from Graduate Student Climate Survey Website on Race and Ethnicity of Tenured Track Faculty Hires Since 2006. It shows three lines for Hispanic, African American, and Native American faculty numbers all going up. It suggests that the campus went from 7% minority faculty in 2006 to 9.1% minority faculty in 2014." />
          <figcaption>Faculty Hire Graph from the Graduate Student Climate Survey Website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          We have received <strong>no data</strong> from the Graduate Student Climate Survey on its diversity questions.  Instead, the Graduate Student Social Climate Survey results webpage features this Bullshit Graph regarding the race/ethnicity of faculty. <strong>It has nothing to do with graduate employees or graduate students at all!</strong> Why does this non sequitur appear in a document that alleges to expose Graduate Student Social Climate Survey results? We have excellent reason to believe that the smoke and mirrors exist because some unpublished survey results so damningly indicate a disparity in feelings of inclusion for minority graduate students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diversity is an area that the University has failed to prioritize in a meaningful way. There is a specific office to address these concerns, The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Community Engagement<sup>10</sup>. At no fault of that office and similar groups, the system in which they exist has prevented them from implementing effective changes.  Graduate student groups, such as the Graduate Student of Color Collective (GSCC)<sup>11</sup>, have been more effective in addressing these issues on campus.
        </p>

    <div class="">
			<h2> What should I do if these issues impact me during my graduate career?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="12u">
		    <p>
          Don’t suffer silently if you face the above issues. Unfortunately, lots of other graduate students are experiencing similar problems. Finding supportive voices from your peers can go a long way.
				</p>
        <p>
          While direct communication with the individual that is hindering your ability to progress as a grad student and professional may be the ideal path forward, the power dynamics may mean direct remedy is not a workable solution for you. Below are a few on-campus resources if you are being plagued by the above issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Find a discreet and wise member of your department to discuss your options. This could come in the form of a more senior graduate student, another faculty member, the graduate chair of your department, or even the department chair. The graduate and department chair of your department can help to mediate discussions with your advisor as well as help with any transition if switching advisors is the best option for you.</li>
          <li> The <a

    <div class="row">
      <div class="12u">
        <p>
          We strongly believe that if we want to change the culture of silenced exploitation of graduate employees, we must speak up and address the administration collectively. It is well known that  the nature of graduate school can make it extremely difficult to speak up about the issues we face. Therefore the most effective way for us to address and resolve those issues and to protect our rights, is through a collective bargaining agreement.  A CBA gives graduate employees the ability to negotiate collectively with the University on all conditions of employment, including all of the issues mentioned above. If you agree with our mission, we strongly encourage you to become a members of CRC and involved in our efforts to be the collective voice of graduate employees.
