The Board of Regents comprises nine elected members who govern the University of Colorado system, including all four campuses: Aurora, Boulder, Colorado Springs, and Denver. The Regents meet monthly at varyious locations to make decisions affecting the entire gamut of university operations.

                The Regents are influential in state-level decisions to allocate funding to higher education. Republicans have held a majority in the Board of Regents since 1979, and they have often aligned themselves against monetary state investment in higher education. Colorado’s colleges and universities have been severely defunded during recent decades. Colorado's per capita investment in higher education funding is ranked 48th among the 50 United States, which means students foot the majority of the bill.

                Top university administrators are aging and approaching retirement.  Each campus has a chancellor that is appointed by the president and this too will likely change. The chancellor in turn appoints the provost, who makes decisions about pay for graduate workers.

                The University of Colorado's endowment vests tens of millions of dollars in fossil fuels. Apart from the economic hazard to the University of investing in the buggy-whip of energy sources, and the environmental hazard to the planet, the University's investment in fossil fuels sullies the public image our university deserves as an eminent leader in climate change research.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>In 2015, CU's Regents voted 7-2 against divestment from fossil fuels, with the two dissenting votes cast by Democrats. Current at-large Democratic Regent, Stephen Ludwig, voted with the Republicans.</p>
                    <p>…&ldquot;We have a lot of scientists doing important climate research … that may not feel as free to do their work under a Republican administration than a Democratic one,&rdquot; [Regent Shoemaker] says. &ldquot;We do definitely have Republicans [on the board] who do not believe that people are impacting the climate.&ldquot;</p>
                    <p>…Less than six percent of CU’s budget is funded by the state. There are no state statutes or constitutional requirements that mandate Colorado spend a certain amount of state funds per student. According to the Fiscal Institute, a Denver-based economic think tank, Colorado ranks 48th in the nation for state funds per full-time student. Only New Hampshire and Vermont spend less.</p>
                    <p>…In 2008 … the board chose current president Bruce Benson, an oil man who was once chairman of the Colorado Republican Party and the GOP nominee for governor in 1994, on a 6-3 party-line vote.</p>

                </blockquote>

                <p>Regent-Elect Heidi Ganahl has derided the notion of fossil fuel divestment. It is expected that were control of the board to flip from Republican control, this issue would come up for vote again.</p>
