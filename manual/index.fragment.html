					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p class="justify">
                        The Committee on Rights and Compensation at CU-Boulder is a group of graduate workers coming together to improve our workplace conditions. We are, that is, a labor union in the original sense of the term. We assembled this "survival manual" as a way to document a few of the struggles we are working to remedy, provide guidance about how to survive life as a graduate worker at CU, and help introduce our case for a legally binding collective bargaining agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="justify">
                        This document is very much a work in progress; we are aware of some problems with it (such as charts displaying poorly on smart phones) and we eagerly encourage help improving it. Does it seem like something is missing? A refrain in this manual is "you are not alone" -- your additions will be appreciated by others. Always feel free to drop us a line at <a href="mailto:info@BoulderCRC.org">info@BoulderCRC.org</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="justify">
                        Together we will make CU a better university!
