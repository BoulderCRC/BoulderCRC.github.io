                <p>
                	The work of a graduate employee on a teaching assistantship does not end at teaching. The work of a research assistant does not end at the lab. The primary work of teaching assistant is the same as the primary work of a research assistant: becoming expert.  Becoming expert is the core of our employment, not an afterthought. Through research, teaching, and study, we are actively transforming ourselves into experts in our fields. This is the very core of our labor, not merely a privilege afforded by the performance of our other duties.
                </p>
                <p>
                	We are employees at 50% (or lower!) who are explicitly prohibited from taking other major employment so that our becoming expert is not affected. The contracts we've signed understand that our task is full time, yet we are not paid enough to live in Boulder or the Denver metro area and work the hours necessary without undue stress.
                </p>
                <p>
                	We must reject the perspective in which it is reasonable to classify our labor as half time. It diminishes our goal, that of becoming expert, and promotes a situation which enables our abuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Seeing ourselves now as full time workers, the course is clear: WE NEED A UNION; WE DESERVE A UNION! The CRC is fighting to become OUR UNION!
                </p>
                <p>
                	You may wonder if you, as a graduate employee, are truly being abused. Consider the fact that the university claims graduate employees only teach 10% of all student course credit hours. This should sound far too low; it is! How do they attain such numbers? Recitation or laboratory hours are credited to the instructors of record; graduate employees are not credited as having taught those courses<sup>1</sup>!  Moreover, in coordinated courses with small sections, it is common for the course coordinator to be credited with teaching all sections of the course; the names of the graduate employees who actually taught those sections is not even listed!
                </p>
                <p>
                	You may believe that you don't deserve to be paid 30k or more, which is a minimal self sufficiency wage for the region. For example you may know school teachers with education certificates who make less than that, and believe that they have more experience and skills than you do right now.
                </p>

                <div class="header">
                	<h3>Two fallacies lie at the heart of that belief.</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                	The first fallacy is the notion that a worker deserves a living wage contingent on their excellence. On the contrary, a worker deserves a living wage for full time work without reservation. Rewards beyond that may be appropriate for excellence, but all who work must be paid enough to live with dignity and security.
                </p>
                <p>
                	The second fallacy is the notion that the dire conditions of other workers justify lowered expectations for oneâ€™s self. But the US remains a staggeringly wealthy nation with ghastly accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few. Increasing our pay does not reduce the pay of the school teacher, the construction worker, the nurse, or the plumber. They deserve better wages too, and together as part of a resurgent international labor movement we fight for them as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                	You may think that unionization of graduate employees introduces an antagonism between graduate employees and our professors and the university. This holds as much water as the premise that a discussion of consent in sexual conduct steals the passion; it's a lie intended to defend the status quo. Instead the aforementioned antagonism is already present between administration and graduate employees, and it is manifest in our abuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                	When economics force us to exceed occupancy limits on homes and therefore risk eviction, when the actual dates of our pay are both varying and mysterious so we incur late fees from rent and other bills, when we have to move every year because our home is being sold and in moving our rent jumps another hundred bucks a month, when you need a root canal that costs enough to make you homeless... These constitute only the beginning of the litany of abuses we endure.
