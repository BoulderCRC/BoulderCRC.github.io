                                            <h3><strong>Provost Moore:</strong></h3>
										</header>
                                        <p>The Committee on Rights and Compensation (CRC) has determined three key issues among graduate employees which we intend to address this semester:
                                        <ul class="text">
                                            <li><h4><strong>Equitable pay</strong></h4>
                                                We demand a 25% pay increase by AY 2017-2018, and an annual cost of living adjustment that accurately reflects cost increases in the City of Boulder, as a step toward a self-sufficient income for graduate employees.</li>
                                            <li><h4><strong>Full tuition waiver</strong></h4>
                                                We demand full tuition remission for all graduate employees, regardless of appointment percentage.</li>
                                            <li><h4><strong>Transparency &amp; inclusion</strong></h4>
                                                We demand prompt release of the 2014 Graduate Social Climate Survey data to the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance and to a trusted third party mutually agreeable to CU and CRC for the purpose of undelayed and uncensored publication of its findings.</li>
                                        </ul></p>

                                        <p>Please respond by October 31st with a commitment to satisfy these demands by AY 2017-2018.</p>

                                        <p>You may remember the CRC from the <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_30024771/cu-boulder-graduate-students-demand-higher-wages-offset">June 16th Regents Meeting</a> where two of our constituent graduate employees spoke to our needs. Our committee formed because the existing structure for channeling our grievances through UGGS has failed. Even when concessions have been granted, they have been small and tardy. For example, UGGS has worked for years towards dental insurance; this work has finally been met this year, but with coverage only for preventative dental care that falls short of medical recommendations. Therefore, we find it necessary to take alternative action.</p>

                                        <p>We understand that UGGS is in parallel discussion with you, and that you wish to channel all discussion through UGGS. Graduate workers raised these issues in the open forum you organized with the stated intent “to increase our communication and transparency across campus”. You deflected towards the ongoing discussion with UGGS all of our questions and complaints. The CRC is a wholly independent organization and we are not bound by any agreements tied to your negotiation with UGGS.</p>

                                        <p>We understand that there is active discussion about what, exactly, a minimum self-sufficient income is. It is specifically for that reason we researched the criteria used by the Colorado Center on Law and Policy and modified them to suit the peculiarities of the task of graduate employees. These criteria were discussed with the Assistant Vice Chancellor for Budget and Fiscal Planning on August 22nd. By every reasonable methodology, a 25% raise will still fall short.</p>

                                        <p>We understand that tuition waivers for graduate employees can fall short of covering their required course load. This configuration is common and unacceptable.</p>

                                        <p>We understand that summary findings about harassment, summer funding, and fees have been published from the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/studentsuccess/campus-climate/graduate-student-social-climate-survey">Graduate Student Social Climate Survey of 2014</a>. However we know that the scope of the survey was much broader than the scope of the findings that have been released. This gives the impression that you and other administrators are withholding unflattering results beyond what was reported as harassment.</p>

                                        <p>While CRC has additional concerns, we have identified these three points as the most critical for improving CU Boulder. We look forward to your commitment to resolve these issues.</p>

                                        <p>Sincerely,<br />
                                        Committee on Rights and Compensation</p>
