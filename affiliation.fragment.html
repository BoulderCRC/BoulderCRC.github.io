      As you may have read in the CRC <a href="https://bouldercrc.org/docs/class-struggle-2020-01-27.pdf">newsletter</a> or Janet Ruppert and John Kelly's recent <a href="https://www.dailycamera.com/2020/02/15/john-kelly-and-janet-ruppert-its-time-for-a-cu-union/">op-ed</a> for the Daily Camera, the Board of the CRC is starting a process of reorganization and affiliation with the Communication Workers of America.  The CRC fought for better working conditions for all graduate workers, but all workers at CU Boulder deserve a union. In uniting with the Communication Workers of America, we'll join a nation-wide network with the resources to demand real change for all CU workers.
    </p>
    <h4>Why a coalition?</h4>
    <p>
      Since 2016, the CRC has fought for the fair treatment and compensation of graduate workers. While we have made progress, it is clear that the administration will not make necessary changes to improve our working and living conditions unless we continue to put pressure on them. Now is the time to make a bold move that will strengthen our ability to compel them to hear our demands. We are not the only workers on this campus who suffer under low wages, inadequate benefits, and demanding workloads. Together we are stronger.
    </p>
    <h4>What does affiliation mean?</h4>
    <p>
    If we vote to affiliate, the CRC will reorganize as a local chapter of the CWA. This wall-to-wall union will be a space for workers to articulate their needs while developing solidarity across classifications and trades to fight for all workers at CU. Our goals will expand to include issues that affect other workers on campus, but we will never stop fighting for better working conditions for graduate students--including a full fee waiver. 
    </p>

    <h4>How does affiliation work?</h4>
    <p>
      Affiliation has three stages. First, fifty volunteers from the CRC as well as any other eligible CU Boulder employee must agree to join the new union local. At this point they will file an application to charter with CWA: this will create a new union local, United Campus Workers (UCW) 7799. Finally, members of the CRC will vote on whether the affiliation should be completed. This will end the nonprofit entity known as the "Committee on Rights and Compensation", and transfer its assets to the non-proft UCW 7799.
    </p>

    <h4>"United Campus Workers"? I thought you said "Communication Workers of America"?</h4>
    <p>
      United Campus Workers is the name of another CWA <a href="https://www.ucw-cwa.org/">local union</a> in Tennessee. Their organization has taken a very similar path as the CRC hopes to follow. In recognition of our shared struggle, it was decided that we would also adopt the "United Campus Workers" moniker. Nevertheless, we will be a CWA affiliate.
    </p>

    <h4>Who's going to run this new organization?</h4>
    <p>
    UCW 7799 will have both an Executive Board and an Officer Core. Members of both will be elected by the union local membership. Members of the CRC Board and organizing core intend to run for these positions, and maintain an active role in the union's operations.
    </p>

    <h4>Will my membership carry over?</h4>
    <p>
      Unfortunately not, CRC members will need to sign up for the new local. To do so please contact us at info@bouldercrc.org, and we can have an organizer send you a digital membership form.
    </p>

<h4>Why should I join?</h4>
<p>
The mission of public higher education has been lost. Budget cuts have left vital CU workers with sub-livable wages, inadequate healthcare, and scarce support for its most vulnerable employees. While CU is raising tuition and fees for its students, it's eroding the quality of the education they receive. If we stand together, we can create a better CU for students and workers alike. 
</p>

<p>
Healthy, happy workers make CU a better public community resource for all. When teachers arenâ€™t facing food insecurity, students win. When researchers have access to healthcare, including mental healthcare, the University wins. When staff can afford to live in Boulder and commute via public transit, the community and environment win. We build strength by organizing together as CU workers to fight against corporate interests and for public education at our University. 
 
This is our union for our university; together we have the power to improve working conditions across the institution, create a learning environment that benefits all our students, and demand change at the local, regional, and state levels. In short, we can create the strongest labor coalition in the state of Colorado.
</p>

  <p>
We look forward to doing it together.
