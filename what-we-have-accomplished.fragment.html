		    <li>Helped our members win thousands of dollars of overdue wages, in consultation with an employment lawyer, and developed <a href="/wagetheft">a web app</a> to streamline the process of initiating the legal process to recover stolen wages at CU</li>
		    <li>Researched how our benefits compare to other universities, found that we're the only Pac-12 university that fails to provide any paid parental leave (<a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_31989719/cu-boulder-grad-students-advocate-paid-parental-leave">front page story</a>)</li>
		    <li>Earned <a href="/docs/BFA-SSS-resolution.pdf">unanimous support from the Boulder Faculty Assembly faculty support (pdf document)</a> that calls for "even more decisive, aggressive, and rapid action" to meet the <a href="/manual/living">local living wage standard</a></li>

	            <li>Met with Dean Schmiesing, Provost Moore, and Chief Financial Officer Fox to communicate the gravity of our issues</li>
		    <li>Initiated communication with, and won support from, numerous state legislators, public officials, and labor leaders</li>
